# Friend-Finder
In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "Friend-Finder" application. Friend-Finder is a friend matching app that matches users to similiar people based on their answers to ten survey questions. The answers range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). When the survey is submitted, an existing person with the closest absolute score of the ten questions combined, is matched with the user.

Friend-Finder utilizes Node.js and Express on the back-end with a Bootstrap front-end framework.

Friend-Finder is deployed to Heroku, and you can find the app
